## Build systems I have enjoyed

- [ninja](https://github.com/langston-barrett/dots/blob/576dc9072e68c5ae33d568f29a4d2c9acedecec7/scripts/lint/lint.py)
- [make](https://github.com/langston-barrett/langston-barrett.github.io/blob/c950dabbd1c5ec4884f0dc39bce373a96818cf46/Makefile)
- [shake](https://github.com/GaloisInc/MATE/tree/ba73c5745c55aba92fa28b4d867bf9faf96e0085/shake)

## Build systems I have tried and avoided

- [tup](https://gittup.org/tup/): can't install via Nix
- [redo](https://redo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): interesting, but unmaintained
