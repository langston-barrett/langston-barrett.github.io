<h1 id="k-llvm">K-LLVM</h1>
<p>A semantics of <a href="/notes/llvm">LLVM</a> in <a href="/notes/k">K</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LLVM is designed for the compile-time, link-time and run-time
optimization of programs written in various programming languages. The
language supported by LLVM targeted by modern compilers is LLVM IR. In
this paper we define K-LLVM, a reference semantics for LLVM IR. To the
best of our knowledge, K-LLVM is the most complete formal LLVM IR
semantics to date, including all LLVM IR instructions, intrinsic
functions in the LLVM documentation and Standard-C library functions
that are necessary to execute many LLVM IR programs. Additionally,
K-LLVM formulates an abstract machine that executes all LLVM IR
instructions. The machine allows to describe our formal semantics in
terms of simulating a conceptual virtual machine that runs LLVM IR
programs, including non-deterministic programs. Even though the K-LLVM
memory model in this paper is assumed to be a sequentially consistent
memory model and does not include all LLVM concurrency memory
behaviors, the design of K-LLVMâ€™s data layout allows the K-LLVM
abstract machine to execute some LLVM IR programs that previous
semantics did not cover, such as the full range of LLVM IR behaviors
for the interaction among LLVM IR casting, pointer arithmetic, memory
operations and some memory flags (e.g. readonly) of function headers.
Additionally, the memory model is modularized in a manner that
supports investigating other memory models. To validate K-LLVM, we
have implemented it in K [41], which generated an interpreter for
LLVM IR. Using this, we ran tests including 1,385 unit test programs
and 2,156 concrete LLVM IR programs, and K-LLVM passed all of them.</p>
