<h1 id="meta-style-guide-1">Meta Style Guide</h1>
<p>This guide is targeted at authors of style guides that are scoped beyond
an individual project, context, or circumstance.</p>
<p>The recommendations in this guide are split into three levels, based on
the author's perception of their relative importance and applicability:</p>
<ul>
<li>[<em>Strongly Recommended</em>]{.spurious-link
target=&quot;*Strongly Recommended&quot;}: These recommendations are broadly
applicable and have a high value-to-weight ratio.</li>
<li>[<em>Recommended</em>]{.spurious-link target=&quot;*Recommended&quot;}: These
recommendations may apply less universally, or be less than
essential to a strong style guide.</li>
<li>[<em>Nice to Have</em>]{.spurious-link target=&quot;*Nice to Have&quot;}: These
recommendations aren't essential to writing a decent style guide;
they're more like the marks of a really high-quality style guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the recommendations within each of the above categories are
sorted in rough order of descending importance.</p>

<h2 id="strongly-recommended">Strongly Recommended</h2>
<h3 id="acknowledgment-of-limitations">Acknowledgment of Limitations</h3>
<p>A style guide should acknowledge that:</p>
<ul>
<li>its prescriptions are not absolute,</li>
<li>the guide is non-exhaustive,</li>
<li>the authors are fallible, and</li>
<li>each recommendation has a set of trade-offs (pros and cons) that
need to be weighed in each context in which a recommendation is
considered.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p><a href="./python.org">My Python style guide</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is my personal style guide for writing Python code. As with
all style guides, this guide is incomplete, fallible, and its
recommendations aren't appropriate for every circumstance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Google C++ style guide
<a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Goals">states</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you understand what goals each rule is serving, it should be
clearer to everyone when a rule may be waived (some can be)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As always, common sense and good taste should prevail.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Such an acknowledgment establishes credibility: If the style guide
is perceived to be pedantic, or the work of authors who are
incapable of recognizing nuance and acknowledging subjectivity, its
content and message will be proportionately less compelling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="justification-1">Justification</h3>
<p>Each item in a style guide should include a discussion of <em>why</em> the
particular recommendation is made. Where appropriate, such
justifications should:</p>
<ul>
<li>explicitly name the goals or concerns that the recommendation
addresses,</li>
<li>discuss the trade-offs (pros and cons) of the recommendation
(especially relative to the explicitly-named goals), and</li>
<li>refer to alternative solutions or styles and discuss their
trade-offs.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>In the Google C++ style guide, the <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Goals">list of
goals</a>
appears before all the recommendations and provides context for
evaluating them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Given the inherent [<em>limited scope and
applicability</em>]{.spurious-link
target=&quot;*Acknowledgment of Limitations&quot;} of style guides, a thorough
discussion of trade-offs for each recommendation aids users in
considering them &quot;à la carte&quot;.</p>
<p>Justifications also educate readers. Recommendations in style guides
are sometimes the product of hard-won experience, and sharing the
experience alongside the recommendation may help others internalize
it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="list-of-recommendations">List of Recommendations</h3>
<p>A style guide should consist of a list of recommendations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Formatting style guides as a list of recommendations allows readers
to consider them &quot;à la carte&quot; for their specific circumstance,
which is crucial given that style guides are inherently [<em>limited in
scope and applicability</em>]{.spurious-link
target=&quot;*Acknowledgment of Limitations&quot;}.</p>
<p>It also makes it easy to refer to a specific recommendation when
describing it to others.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="recommendations-should-pull-their-weight">Recommendations Should Pull Their Weight</h3>
<p>As described <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Goals">in the Google C++ style
guide</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The benefit of a style rule must be large enough to justify asking all
of our engineers to remember it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>This style guide doesn't explicitly call out that style guides
should be written in a language that is widely understood among the
target audience, because this is assumed to be in the &quot;background
of obviousness&quot; - the shared set of assumptions and understandings
between the author and the majority of the audience.</p>
<p>Also from the Google C++ style guide:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>for example, <code>goto</code> contravenes many of the following principles,
but is already vanishingly rare, so the Style Guide doesn't
discuss it.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Narrowing the scope helps keep the guide relatively concise and
focused on higher-leverage recommendations. This increases the
overall value of the reading and applying the style guide, relative
to other approaches to increasing project quality.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2>
<h3 id="naming-an-audience">Naming an Audience</h3>
<p>Style guides should explicitly name an audience.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is a JavaScript style guide aimed at first-time programmers
who are learning JavaScript and are looking for guidance on
writing readable, maintainable code.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an in-house Haskell style guide for Company X. It's aimed
at intermediate Haskell programmers working at Company X who want
to write code that is in-line with the pre-existing style that's
widely used across our codebases.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Naming an audience helps readers quickly evaluate whether or not the
majority of the recommendations will apply to their circumstance.</p>
<p>Moreover, it establishes a context in which to evaluate the addition
or omission of recommendations (see [<em>Recommendations Should Pull
Their Weight</em>]{.spurious-link
target=&quot;*Recommendations Should Pull Their Weight&quot;}).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="naming-a-scope">Naming a Scope</h3>
<p>In addition to naming an audience and prioritizing the recommendations,
style guides may also name a scope that delimits which recommendations
are considered for inclusion.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html">The Google Java Style
Guide</a> says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this document focuses primarily on the hard-and-fast rules that we
follow universally, and avoids giving advice that isn't clearly
enforceable (whether by human or tool).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>This shares most of the benefits of [<em>Naming an
Audience</em>]{.spurious-link target=&quot;*Naming an Audience&quot;}.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="prioritization">Prioritization</h3>
<p>Recommandations should have an associated <em>level</em> or <em>degree</em> of
importance or applicability.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>This guide is split into three sections: &quot;Strongly Recommended&quot;,
&quot;Recommended&quot;, and &quot;Nice to Have&quot;.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html">Google TypeScript style
guide</a> uses the
terminology of <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119">RFC
2119</a> (e.g.,
&quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, &quot;MUST&quot;, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>All style guide recommendations are circumstantial, and so such
prioritization is equally circumstantial. However, if the reader
finds many of the recommendations in a given guide to be useful,
they are likely to also agree with the degree of importance that the
authors assign to their recommendations. The reader can then focus
on applying the recommendations that provide them with highest value
first or most stringently, increasing the overall utility of the
guide.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="examples-6">Examples</h3>
<p>Each recommendation should be accompanied by at least one example. Both
positive and negative examples are helpful.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p>This example is an example of including an example.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Including examples is a concise way to confirm (or develop) a
reader's understanding of what situations are being referred to by
the recommendation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="nice-to-have">Nice to Have</h2>
<h3 id="identifiers-and-permalinks">Identifiers and Permalinks</h3>
<p>Each recommendation should have some specific way of being referred to.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<ul>
<li>Each recommendation could have an immutable identifier that
doesn't change between versions</li>
<li>Each recommendation could have a number in a list that may
change between versions, but old versions could be made
permanently available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pros</p>
<p>This makes it easy to refer to specific recommendations with
little effort, and with the confidence that the reasoning behind
your decisions will be faithfully preserved online.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cons</p>
<p>May entail more work for the style guide author.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>Where the enforcement of a given recommendation can be automated, a
style guide should include a reference or description of how to do so.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Examples</p>
<p><a href="https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#21-lint">The Google Python Style
Guide</a>
recommends use of Pylint with a specific configuration file.</p>
<p>Style guides might also just list a particular rule identifier for a
given tool, or have an inline snippet of a
<a href="https://semgrep.dev/">semgrep</a> rule. (However, inline linter rules
or scripts for automation should be very short or hidden by default
for the sake of brevity).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Justification</p>
<p>Automation reduces the cognitive and time burdens of enforcement: a
team can decide to adopt a recommendation and then never need to
discuss it or bring it up in code reviews again, because they use
tooling that enforces it.</p>
<p>Moreover, the authors of style guides are often the sort of people
who know more about tooling for enforcing stylistic/best practice
recommendations, and so are in a good position to write or recommend
such tooling.</p>
</li>
</ol>
