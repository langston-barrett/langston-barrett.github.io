<p>Q. In bunched logic, which of the two implications is called multiplicative, and which is called additive?</p>
<p>A. → is additive and -∗ is multiplicative</p>
<!-- marki[card] -->
<p>Q. In bunched logic, how are the ∗ and -∗ connectives related?</p>
<p>A. By the deduction theorem: A ∗ B ⊢ C iff A ⊢ B -∗ C</p>
